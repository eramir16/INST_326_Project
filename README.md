One to four sentences explaining what your project is and what it does.
Our project is a program which emulates a delivery application. A user will be able to select an item for delivery and get said item delivered to them. This is done by our application asking a user to enter various data (addresses, contact info, etc) and then, by utilizing our algorithms and functions, our app will create a dynamic receipt with relevant information (such as time for delivery and price).

An explanation on how to run the program from the command line.

This website provides various insights into the Tkinter library within python. We utilized this website in order to better educate ourselves with regards to the versatility and implementation factors which Tkinter has to offer. The usage of the information obtained from this site is most prominent in our GUI. Though very useful and informative, minor additional resources were required for further Tkinter usage within our program.
